# Get Wallet Details Using All Mesh Wallet Hooks

The purpose of this simple application is to show one of the advantages of web3 regarding ownership data in the form of credentials, users can log in and enter a web page using a crypto asset or NFT.

The way it works is very simple, if the system detects the asset or NFT name and the corresponding policyID then the user is allowed to enter the web page.

Disclaimer: This application is just a prototype so it cannot guarantee 100% security. This application is still very simple and is not equipped with a complete authentication system. In the future, it might be possible to develop it again using Auth.js.

## Demo

To see how it works, let's look at the recorded video where I shared and demonstrated this application on the Indonesian Cardano Developers Community Youtube channel. Look at the timestamp **_1:37:33_** and here is the [link](https://youtu.be/4HynIULuhxo?list=PLUj8499OocHiL8gXPv8wMlLW-zIcyYdrQ)
